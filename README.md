1) Two users play Pig Dice.
2) A single "die" is represented by an image of one of the six sides of a standard die.
3) Users decide who goes first by rolling the die and guessing which side of the die will be displayed (1 through 6). The  user whose guess is closest to the displayed side of the die goes first.
 User's can't use the same number for their guess.
4) Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
5) If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
6) If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
7) If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
8) The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
9) The user who wins will be shown a "Winner" page.
10) Once either user has clicked to Play Again, the game will restart.
